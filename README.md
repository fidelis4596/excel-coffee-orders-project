# Coffee Orders Project (Interactive Dashboard using MS Excel)

## 📌 Project Objective
The goal of the Coffee Orders Project is to analyse coffee sales data in order to understand customer behaviour, top-selling products, order trends, and performance across different countries. The insights from this analysis will help the business improve sales strategies and customer targeting.



## 📊 Dataset Used
- <a href= "https://github.com/fidelis4596/excel-coffee-orders-project/blob/main/coffeeOrdersData.xlsx">DataSet</a>


## ❓ Key Questions (KPIs)
- How do sales trends change over time for each coffee type? 
- Which country contributes the most to total sales?  
- Which coffee type or roast type sells the most?  
- Which customer segment (loyalty card holders vs non-holders) contributes more to the total sales?  
- Top 5 customers by total sales.


## ⚙️ Process
1. Checked the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies  
2. Standardized data types and formats (dates, text fields, numerical values)  
3. Cleaned the data and ensured consistency across the Orders, Customers, and Products tables  
4. Built PivotTables to answer each KPI  
5. Created charts such as column charts and line charts to visualize insights  
6. Designed a single interactive dashboard by combining all PivotCharts  
7. Added slicers for  Roast Type, size and loyalty card to make the dashboard fully dynamic
