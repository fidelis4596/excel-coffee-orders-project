4. Built PivotTables to answer each KPI  
5. Created charts such as column charts, line charts, and donut charts to visualize insights  
6. Designed a single interactive dashboard by combining all PivotCharts  
7. Added slicers for Country, Coffee Type, Roast Type, and Purchase Date to make the dashboard fully dynamic
